# 😁 happy

happy is a website and mobile software developed during the Next Level Week #3 from Rocketseat, with aim to find orphanages to visit them.
note: This is the website, mobile and backend you can find on my profile.
 
### 💻 Tech 
happy uses some open source projects to work properly:

  * [Node.js]
  * [react]
  
  
### 🔨 Installation 

devRadar requires [node.js] to run.

To run this project, you must install all dependecies from web running the command below in all folders, then just start the project.

```sh
$ npm install
```

after installing all dependecies run this command to start the web:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Then happy web will start in localhost at:

```sh
localhost:3000
```
